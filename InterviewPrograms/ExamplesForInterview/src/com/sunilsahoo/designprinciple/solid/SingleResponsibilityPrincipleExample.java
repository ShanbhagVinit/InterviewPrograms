 *         One class should have one and only one responsibility
 * 
 *         The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that there should
 *         never be more than one reason for a class to change. This means that
 *         every class, or similar structure, in your code should have only one
 *         job to do. Everything in the class should be related to that single
 *         purpose, i.e. be cohesive. It does not mean that your classes should
 *         only contain one method or property. There can be a lot of members as
 *         long as they relate to the single responsibility. It may be that when
 *         the one reason to change occurs, multiple members of the class may
 *         need modification. It may also be that multiple classes will require
 *         updates.
